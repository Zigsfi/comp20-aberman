I was unable to access the REDLINE api using XMLHttpRequest, due to the AJAX same origin policy. 

Most of the code for accessing the maps api is borrowed from Google's tutorials on the subject. 

I've spent about 4 hours on this assignment, most of which was spent researching ways around the same origin policy. 

It is not possible to retrieve data using the specific endpoint provided, but the MBTA does provide an API that can be accessed via client-side javascript.
