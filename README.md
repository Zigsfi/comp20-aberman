COMP 20 Fall 2014 Private Repo for Arthur Berman
*  This git repository contains the work I did for Web Programming at Tufts University in Fall 2014
*  My favorite assignment was the marauder's map, because I developed many skills related to using front-end Javascript. 
*  This course has improved my mindfulness of good programming practices and inspired me to focus more on stability and robustness in software design. 
*  The most important thing I've learned in this course is to code for the worst case: the issues I had implementing mongodb support stemmed from my only paying attention to the best case scenario, and the various flaws exposed in the security assignment showed me how to think about the worst case scenario while programming. 
*  Now that I have finished the course, I intend to learn more about security and user experience design.
